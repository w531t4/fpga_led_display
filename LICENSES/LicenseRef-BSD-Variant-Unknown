Upstream licensing notice states only: "License=BSD".
No specific BSD variant (e.g. BSD-2-Clause or BSD-3-Clause) is identified.

This code is therefore interpreted as being released under a
BSD-style permissive license, allowing use, modification, and
redistribution with attribution, consistent with common BSD terms.

All upstream copyright and license notices are preserved.

The exact BSD license variant is unknown.
